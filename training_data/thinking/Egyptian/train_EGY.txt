You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: ḥkn ⸗č m ꜥnḫ m ꜣw.t-ꞽb +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ꜣw.t ꞽb is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a NV.VID, i.e. a nominal phrase (N) that is derived from a verbal expression (V), where the verbal expression is a verbal idiom or VID. An example similar to the current one is the English NV.VID "a heart breaker", which derives from the VID "to break one's heart". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as it is lexically idiomatic: it takes on a meaning that is unique to this combination of words. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: ꜣw.t ꞽb; 6,7</think>ꜣw.t ꞽb; 6,7*#*#*#*

Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  m hrw pn is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: m hrw pn; 6,7,8</think>m hrw pn; 6,7,8*#*#*#*

Sentence: bw.t Wnꞽś pꞽ ꞽb.t +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ꞽ:ḫm(.w) śk(.w) is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a NV.VID, i.e. a nominal phrase (N) that is derived from a verbal expression (V), where the verbal expression is a verbal idiom or VID. An example similar to the current one is the English NV.VID "a heart breaker", which derives from the VID "to break one's heart". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as it is lexically idiomatic: it takes on a meaning that is unique to this combination of words. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Sentence: ꞽm.(ꞽ)w nn.t n Wnꞽś pn +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  p(w) nn is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: ꞽw.n ⸗f ḫr ⸗č Nsr.t +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2.

More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival/adverbial modifier derived from a verbal idiom (AV.VID). Substituting individual lexemes by synonyms disrupts the idiomatic reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 because it is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: nfr ḥr; 1,3</think>nfr ḥr; 1,3*#*#*#*

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  č̣i̯ mrw.t is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: tmm rʾ ⸗k ꞽn š(m)ś.t +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Sentence: ꞽ(w) ⸗k tr rr ꞽm +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'.

Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: čn ꞽr.w ⸗k +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: nꞽ ḥmś.w Ttꞽ pn m č̣ꜣč̣ꜣ.t nčr +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The lexemes are not replaceable by synonyms without altering acceptability or meaning (e.g., “condemn it!” does not convey the idiomatic force), which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2, because the meaning of the expression as a whole is not obvious from the meanings of the individual words.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ꞽr ⸗k is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an interjection idiom (IntjID): a conventionalized exclamative unit used to express affect, as in the English IntjID “damn it!”. The lexemes are not replaceable by synonyms without altering acceptability or meaning (e.g., “condemn it!” does not convey the idiomatic force), which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2, because the meaning of the expression as a whole is not obvious from the meanings of the individual words. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 (w)ṭ św is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: ꞽr ⸗k; 3,4|(w)ṭ św; 9,11</think>ꞽr ⸗k; 3,4|(w)ṭ św; 9,11*#*#*#*

And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Wnꞽś pꞽ ꜥpr ꞽꜥb ꜣḫ(.w) ⸗f +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1.

More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 m ḥꜣ(.w) is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 m ꜥw is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station".

The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  m m is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'.

And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: ꜣḫ ꞽr p.t šꜣ.t ꞽr tꜣ +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 m m is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 ḥr.t ꞽb is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  m ꜥw is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 šsp ꞽb is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: m ꜥw; 14,15|šsp ꞽb; 23,24</think>m ꜥw; 14,15|šsp ꞽb; 23,24*#*#*#*

Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: [Č̣ḥw.tꞽ] sꞽn ⸗f rṭ(.wꞽ) ⸗k Ttꞽ +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: ꜥnḫ Ttꞽ m tʾ ṭwꜣ(.w) ꞽw m rr ⸗f +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1.

Sentence: č̣(ṭ) mṭw wn ꜥꜣ(.wꞽ) p.t +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'.

 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  č̣č̣ ꜥw is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  (w)ṭ.n ẖr is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently adpositional verb (IAV): a verb that forms a fixed unit with a specific adposition (similar to the English IAV “come across). The verb and adposition are fixed; substituting the preposition or verb with near‑synonyms disrupts the conventional reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: (w)ṭ.n ẖr; 1,7</think>(w)ṭ.n ẖr; 1,7*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 [č̣i̯] ꜥw.w(ꞽ) is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: m ḫśf(.w); 3,4|[č̣i̯] ꜥw.w(ꞽ); 6,8</think>m ḫśf(.w); 3,4|[č̣i̯] ꜥw.w(ꞽ); 6,8*#*#*#*

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is a NV.VID, i.e. a nominal phrase (N) that is derived from a verbal expression (V), where the verbal expression is a verbal idiom or VID. An example similar to the current one is the English NV.VID "a heart breaker", which derives from the VID "to break one's heart". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as it is lexically idiomatic: it takes on a meaning that is unique to this combination of words. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: fṭ.t ⸗k m fṭ.t pśč̣.t(ꞽ) +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 ꞽr mśꞽꜣ.t is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 m hrw ⸗k pn is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ꜣw ꞽb is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  fꜣ ḥr is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: fꜣ ḥr; 3,4</think>fꜣ ḥr; 3,4*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ꞽm.(ꞽ)w ḫt is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ẖnw ꜥw(.wꞽ) is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: ẖnw ꜥw(.wꞽ); 15,16</think>ẖnw ꜥw(.wꞽ); 15,16*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: č̣(ṭ) mṭw ꞽ:(n)č̣-(⸗ꞽ)-ḥr ⸗č ḥꜣ.t(ꞽ)t +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:
1 č̣(ṭ)
2 mṭw
3-5(a contracted form consisting of the two following lemmas) ꞽ:(n)č̣-(⸗ꞽ)-ḥr
3 ꞽ:(n)č̣
4 (⸗ꞽ)
5 ḥr
6 ⸗č
7 ḥꜣ.t(ꞽ)t
Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ꞽ:(n)č̣ ḥr is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
