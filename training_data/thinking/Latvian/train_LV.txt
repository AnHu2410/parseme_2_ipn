You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  par katru cenu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  veikti pasūtījumi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Tur viens džeks krustdūrienā izšūtā kreklā, galifē biksēs un cepurē ar nagu, magone vai kaut kāda cita puķe aizsprausta aiz auss, uzkāris kaklā tādu garu šņori ar baranku riepām līdz viduklim, staigāja pa ciemu dziedādams. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kaut kāda cita is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kaut kur is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kas par is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: kas par; 11,12</think>kas par; 11,12*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices.

Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Visi tie is a multiword expression.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kaut ko is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 četrās sienās is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: kaut ko; 2,3|četrās sienās; 28,29</think>kaut ko; 2,3|četrās sienās; 28,29*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Atklāsmi negaidīti sniedza Kurts Vonnegūts. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Atklāsmi sniedza is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Atklāsmi sniedza; 1,3</think>Atklāsmi sniedza; 1,3*#*#*#*

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kā arī is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: kā arī; 28,29</think>kā arī; 28,29*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: U. stāstīja, ka viņiem skolā esot ņēmuši kaut kādas analīzes no dibena. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kaut kādas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Sentence: Manas pēdējās atmiņas par viņu – rīta agrumā mēs viens aiz otra stāvam izbrauktuvē no viesnīcas stāvvietas, pareizāk sakot, sēžam katrs savā mašīnā, pirms griezt augšā uz galvenā ceļa. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  viens otra is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: viens otra; 10,12|pareizāk sakot; 19,20</think>viens otra; 10,12|pareizāk sakot; 19,20*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  nez cik is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

 pats par sevi saprotams is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 tās visas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

 kaut kādas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Tā ka nekādas vakariņas kopā tur vispār nesanāks. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Tā ka is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  tādu kā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 uz vietas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: tādu kā; 17,18|uz vietas; 35,36</think>tādu kā; 17,18|uz vietas; 35,36*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Meitene cēlās kājās - tas izskatījās kā palēninātā filmā, lēni un smagi, un it kā nevis ar muskuļu, bet gribas spēku - kā pārvarot milzīgas gravitācijas lauku, -viņa devās pāri zālei pie vīrieša, kurš vēl arvien neļāva savā sejā iezagties ne mazākajai emociju ēnai. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  galvu nodūrusi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival/adverbial modifier derived from a verbal idiom (AV.VID). Substituting individual lexemes by synonyms disrupts the idiomatic reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 because it is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 kaut ko is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 ik pa is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 ik pa brīdim is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Sieviete galdam pārliekusies, lai būtu pēc iespējas tuvāk vīrietim, vaigi sasārtuši, acis mirdz. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  pēc iespējas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  sausu šampanieti is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 pēc tam is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: sausu šampanieti; 15,16|pēc tam; 65,66</think>sausu šampanieti; 15,16|pēc tam; 65,66*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

 tai pašā is a multiword expression.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Kā nu kuro reizi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Viesi, klusinātās balsīs vai ar tik tikko manāmu galvas mājienu sasveicinājušies, ieņem vietas. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  tik tikko is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: tik tikko; 7,8</think>tik tikko; 7,8*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  aizraujas elpa is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 tāpēc ka is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  beigu galā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 metu mieru is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: beigu galā; 14,15|metu mieru; 16,17</think>beigu galā; 14,15|metu mieru; 16,17*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Pļāpu kules is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 neslavu ceļot is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Pļāpu kules; 1,2|neslavu ceļot; 19,20</think>Pļāpu kules; 1,2|neslavu ceļot; 19,20*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 uz visām četrām debesu pusēm is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  lai lūst vai plīst is a multiword expression.

More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  droši vien is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Tā pat vien pavērties, bez domas kādas. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Tā pat vien is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Tā pat vien; 1,2,3</think>Tā pat vien; 1,2,3*#*#*#*

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Cilvēcība manī vēl kāda nebūt saglabājusies. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kāda nebūt is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  par baltu velti is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1.

The lexemes are not replaceable by synonyms without altering acceptability or meaning (e.g., “condemn it!” does not convey the idiomatic force), which satisfies condition 1.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ienācis prātā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 par velti is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: ienācis prātā; 5,6|par velti; 29,30</think>ienācis prātā; 5,6|par velti; 29,30*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: A to sanāk, ka tikai tie kādi pieci vai desmit, vai piecdesmit gudrinieki tur, augšā, to jēgu zina. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  A to is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: A to; 1,2</think>A to; 1,2*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 dod svētību is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ne tikai is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached.

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  lielās līnijās is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 jādabū uz papīra is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Viņš labprāt pastāstīs par jūs ieinteresējošo preci, organizēs degustāciju, sniegs rekomendācijas, ieteiks labu recepti. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  sniegs rekomendācijas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: sniegs rekomendācijas; 12,13</think>sniegs rekomendācijas; 12,13*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Krūšu palielināšanu veic, ja sievietei nav attīstīti šie orgāni vai tie ir viņai nepieņemami maza apjoma, kā arī, ja skaistās, tvirtās krūtis ir izmainījušās pēc bērna dzimšanas. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  palielināšanu veic is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 kā arī is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ņemot vērā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

 krūšu kurvja is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Tā dziļi iekšā, un netika no tā vaļā. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  netika vaļā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a fully non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.full. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas full refers to the fact that all parts of the given expression are non-compositional. This multiword expression is comparable to the English IVPC.full "to do in", where the meaning of the entire expression ("to kill") cannot be derived from either of its components. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as its meaning is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  metas virsū is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semi-semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: – Vai, manu, vai! +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Vai manu vai is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an interjection idiom (IntjID): a conventionalized exclamative unit used to express affect, as in the English IntjID “damn it!”. The lexemes are not replaceable by synonyms without altering acceptability or meaning (e.g., “condemn it!” does not convey the idiomatic force), which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2, because the meaning of the expression as a whole is not obvious from the meanings of the individual words. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Vai manu vai; 2,4,6</think>Vai manu vai; 2,4,6*#*#*#*

The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 kas par is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  katru otro is a multiword expression.

Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: – Tad tu salauzīsi kādu kāju vai ko citu, – Cvībaks paraustīja plecus. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ko citu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 paraustīja plecus is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: ko citu; 8,9|paraustīja plecus; 13,14</think>ko citu; 8,9|paraustīja plecus; 13,14*#*#*#*

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Viņš nelīdzinājās tiem puscilvēkiem, kuri tepat blakus vienā dieva mierā darīja savu darāmo. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  vienā dieva mierā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: vienā dieva mierā; 9,10,11</think>vienā dieva mierā; 9,10,11*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kaut kādā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 šis tas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 iedzīt strupceļā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The given expression fulfills condition 2, as it is lexically idiomatic: it takes on a meaning that is unique to this combination of words. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Vārdu sakot, par visu, kas bija ievīstīts zili baltajā lakatā un tajā naktī, kad dega Maskavas priekšpilsēta, lakatam sākot gruzdēt, gandrīz izbira liesmu apņemtajā pagalmā, es biju samaksājis pārpārēm. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Vārdu sakot is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 pildītu misiju is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 vilktu dzīvību is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kaut kas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1.

More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  negribu dzirdēt is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a multi-verb construction, or MVC. MVCs are VMWEs composed by a sequence of two adjacent verbs (in a language-dependent order). These MVCs follow the following patterns: They usually have the same subject. They usually denote actions that are closely connected and may be seen as part of the same event. They function together as a single predicate. They are unaccompanied by any explicit coordination, subordination, or dependency marker. They only have a single tense, aspect and polarity value. They may be idiomatic or indicate successions of events. One of the verbs is semantically delexicalized and the other verb contains the core meaning of the whole. A similar MVC in English would be "(to) let go".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is semantically and syntactically idiomatic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Vitālā spēka sargātāji, kā tad. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  dabūja zināt is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a multi-verb construction, or MVC. MVCs are VMWEs composed by a sequence of two adjacent verbs (in a language-dependent order). These MVCs follow the following patterns: They usually have the same subject. They usually denote actions that are closely connected and may be seen as part of the same event. They function together as a single predicate. They are unaccompanied by any explicit coordination, subordination, or dependency marker. They only have a single tense, aspect and polarity value. They may be idiomatic or indicate successions of events. One of the verbs is semantically delexicalized and the other verb contains the core meaning of the whole. A similar MVC in English would be "(to) let go".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is semantically and syntactically idiomatic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kur kurā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 atslēgas kaula is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal derived from a causative light-verb construction (NV.LVC.cause). The construction is similar to the construction “doubt-raiser” in English, which originates from the LVC.cause “to raise doubts”. In this construction, a verb combines with a noun and the verb contributes primarily causation rather than its full lexical meaning. The lexemes cannot be freely replaced by synonyms without altering the conventional meaning, which satisfies condition 1. The expression fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity: the verb’s meaning has a causative function. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Pirms tam is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 jāveic darbi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 kā arī is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Pirms tam; 1,2|jāveic darbi; 3,5|kā arī; 24,25</think>Pirms tam; 1,2|jāveic darbi; 3,5|kā arī; 24,25*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  tai pašā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 aizvedīs tautiņās is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1.

 galvu reibinošo is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 mīlestību no pirmā acu skatiena is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: E. A.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  dod iespēju is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  veiktās operācijas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal stemming from a full light verb construction (NV.LVC.full). NV describes the fact that a noun (N) is derived from a verb (V), whereas LVC.full refers to the full light verb construction which is the basis for this multiword expression. An English example is "decision maker", which stems from the LVC.full "(to) make (a) decision". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the deverbal noun does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached.

It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 pa īstam is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Finālcīņā pēcspēles metienos uzvaru guva Valsts ģimnāzijas komanda. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  uzvaru guva is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: uzvaru guva; 4,5</think>uzvaru guva; 4,5*#*#*#*

Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  veiktu remontu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: veiktu remontu; 7,10</think>veiktu remontu; 7,10*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely.

Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Neraugoties uz aizvien pieaugošo Vācijas sabiedrības neapmierinātību, Merkele uzstāj, ka viņas lēmums bijis pareizs. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Neraugoties uz is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Neraugoties uz; 1,2</think>Neraugoties uz; 1,2*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  pēc tam is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 melno segumu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  peļņu nenes is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  sniegtās informācijas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal stemming from a full light verb construction (NV.LVC.full). NV describes the fact that a noun (N) is derived from a verb (V), whereas LVC.full refers to the full light verb construction which is the basis for this multiword expression. An English example is "decision maker", which stems from the LVC.full "(to) make (a) decision". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the deverbal noun does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  rast iespēju is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  tā saucamā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 kā arī is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 miesas bojājumus is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ne vienā vien is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 saistībā ar is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1.

It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Sportisti trenējas vaiga sviedros un ir gatavi izcīnīt uzvaras. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  vaiga sviedros is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

NV describes the fact that a noun (N) is derived from a verb (V), whereas LVC.full refers to the full light verb construction which is the basis for this multiword expression. An English example is "decision maker", which stems from the LVC.full "(to) make (a) decision". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the deverbal noun does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Uzsvars likts is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  izteiktu pateicību is a multiword expression.

A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semi-semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Reti kur is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Reti kur; 1,2</think>Reti kur; 1,2*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Bet gan is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 cienījama vecuma is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Bet gan; 1,2|cienījama vecuma; 17,18</think>Bet gan; 1,2|cienījama vecuma; 17,18*#*#*#*

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  izcīnot uzvaru is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: izcīnot uzvaru; 11,12</think>izcīnot uzvaru; 11,12*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  agri vai vēlu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 gulsies uz pleciem is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  tai pat is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Kokteiļi, lai vai kādi būtu laiki, ir un paliek nemainīga vērtība klasiskos un šikos restorānos, vienkāršos bāros, mājas viesībās un kur tik vēl ne. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  lai vai kādi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: lai vai kādi; 3,4,5</think>lai vai kādi; 3,4,5*#*#*#*

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kļūdu pieļauj is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  aiz kadra is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 dotu mājienu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached.

More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely.

The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 bez tam is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 iekarot sirdi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  svaru kausos mērīt is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 vai nu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  sakopšanu veic is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is an interjection idiom (IntjID): a conventionalized exclamative unit used to express affect, as in the English IntjID “damn it!”. The lexemes are not replaceable by synonyms without altering acceptability or meaning (e.g., “condemn it!” does not convey the idiomatic force), which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2, because the meaning of the expression as a whole is not obvious from the meanings of the individual words. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 nelaba dūša is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semi-semantic idiomaticity.

It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  uz labu bijis is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  veica pārbaudi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: veica pārbaudi; 6,8</think>veica pārbaudi; 6,8*#*#*#*

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  lielāko tiesu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: lielāko tiesu; 18,19</think>lielāko tiesu; 18,19*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Atsaucoties uz neoficiālu informāciju, "Diena" vēsta, ka šonedēļ liecības sniegs arī TP frakcijas deputāts Raimonds Pauls, kurš 7.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  liecības sniegs is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kā nekā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: kā nekā; 10,11</think>kā nekā; 10,11*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Un tā nu mēs smēķējam viens otram virsū, un šņācam viens otram virsū, un ēdam viens otru nost bez sāls. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  viens otram is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

 ēdam nost bez sāls is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”.

 visu labu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an interjection idiom (IntjID): a conventionalized exclamative unit used to express affect, as in the English IntjID “damn it!”. The lexemes are not replaceable by synonyms without altering acceptability or meaning (e.g., “condemn it!” does not convey the idiomatic force), which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2, because the meaning of the expression as a whole is not obvious from the meanings of the individual words. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ne tikai is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 pie varas nāca is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  sniedza solokoncertu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  vairāk vai mazāk is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Ja pēc maltītes pāri paliek kādi gatavi produkti, nemet tos laukā! +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:
1 Ja

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  pāri paliek is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semi-semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: pāri paliek; 4,5</think>pāri paliek; 4,5*#*#*#*

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Lai gan is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 nebūt ne jausmas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 tālēs zilajās is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Lai gan; 1,2|nebūt ne jausmas; 10,11,12|tālēs zilajās; 20,21</think>Lai gan; 1,2|nebūt ne jausmas; 10,11,12|tālēs zilajās; 20,21*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Tā soli pa solītim gājām uz priekšu. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely.

It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Ja dzīvotu Amerikā, viņa būtu karsējmeitene un visi zēni beigtos nost viņas dēļ. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  beigtos nost is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a fully non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.full. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas full refers to the fact that all parts of the given expression are non-compositional. This multiword expression is comparable to the English IVPC.full "to do in", where the meaning of the entire expression ("to kill") cannot be derived from either of its components. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as its meaning is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: beigtos nost; 11,12</think>beigtos nost; 11,12*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3.

More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 jebkurš cits is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal stemming from a full light verb construction (NV.LVC.full). NV describes the fact that a noun (N) is derived from a verb (V), whereas LVC.full refers to the full light verb construction which is the basis for this multiword expression. An English example is "decision maker", which stems from the LVC.full "(to) make (a) decision". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the deverbal noun does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Tas ir tik dabiski, ka par to diezin vai vajadzētu diskutēt. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes.

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  diezin vai is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

 risinājums panākams is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1.

More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 kuru katru brīdi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  sniegt informāciju is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 pabīdot malā is a multiword expression.

It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Tiesa, tie abi izrādās Ādažu privātklīnikas čeki, savukārt, izdzirdējis jautājumus par valsts Onkoloģijas centru, ministrs attrauc, ka pēdējās dienās esot operēts divas reizes, bet savu veselības stāvokli nekomentēšot. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  tie abi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: tie abi; 3,4</think>tie abi; 3,4*#*#*#*

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  tai pašā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 tai pašā laikā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 izdarīt izvēles is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 attiecībā uz is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 kaut kādām is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1.

More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 lai gan is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  no jauna is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 iestūrēt laulības ostā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Māksliniece labprāt atklāj savu dienas režīmu, stāstot ka ceļas vēlu, jo bieži vien gulēt aiziet ļoti vēlu, pieceļoties seko brokastu ēšana, e-pastu pārbaude, zvanu izdarīšana un izbraucieni uz mēģinājumiem vai tērpu pielaikošanām. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  zvanu izdarīšana is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal stemming from a full light verb construction (NV.LVC.full). NV describes the fact that a noun (N) is derived from a verb (V), whereas LVC.full refers to the full light verb construction which is the basis for this multiword expression. An English example is "decision maker", which stems from the LVC.full "(to) make (a) decision". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the deverbal noun does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  netīrās veļas mazgāšana is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a NV.VID, i.e. a nominal phrase (N) that is derived from a verbal expression (V), where the verbal expression is a verbal idiom or VID. An example similar to the current one is the English NV.VID "a heart breaker", which derives from the VID "to break one's heart". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as it is lexically idiomatic: it takes on a meaning that is unique to this combination of words. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 ienāk prātā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: netīrās veļas mazgāšana; 5,6,7|ienāk prātā; 20,21</think>netīrās veļas mazgāšana; 5,6,7|ienāk prātā; 20,21*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices.

More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 bet arī is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".

 izrāda rūpes is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Pēc trešā bērna nākšanas pasaulē pamatīgi pieņēmos svarā. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  nākšanas pasaulē is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a NV.VID, i.e. a nominal phrase (N) that is derived from a verbal expression (V), where the verbal expression is a verbal idiom or VID. An example similar to the current one is the English NV.VID "a heart breaker", which derives from the VID "to break one's heart". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as it is lexically idiomatic: it takes on a meaning that is unique to this combination of words. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: nākšanas pasaulē; 4,5</think>nākšanas pasaulē; 4,5*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  No vienas puses is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 jālauza galva is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices.

More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 ne viens vien is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  izdarījusi pašnāvību is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 bojā gājuši is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: izdarījusi pašnāvību; 11,12|bojā gājuši; 29,30</think>izdarījusi pašnāvību; 11,12|bojā gājuši; 29,30*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'.

And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Rīkojies tā: kad pienāk nākošā reize un viss pēļos atkal notiek kā pēc notīm, iečuksti viņam ausī kādu neķītru fantāziju un pasaki, cik ļoti tevi uzbudinātu tās izmēģināšana dzīvē. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  kā pēc notīm is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: kā pēc notīm; 13,14,15</think>kā pēc notīm; 13,14,15*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal stemming from a full light verb construction (NV.LVC.full). NV describes the fact that a noun (N) is derived from a verb (V), whereas LVC.full refers to the full light verb construction which is the basis for this multiword expression. An English example is "decision maker", which stems from the LVC.full "(to) make (a) decision". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the deverbal noun does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  lasa lekcijas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: lasa lekcijas; 7,8</think>lasa lekcijas; 7,8*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  neko tādu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: neko tādu; 15,16</think>neko tādu; 15,16*#*#*#*

It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  tā dēvēto is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 pie varas nāca is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: tā dēvēto; 5,6|pie varas nāca; 22,23,24</think>tā dēvēto; 5,6|pie varas nāca; 22,23,24*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Kādreiz pastāvēja uzskats, ka pie Pārdaugavas pieminekļa pulcējas tikai pensionāri un, kad viņi aizies citā pasaulē, piemineklis pats par sevi paliks neapdzīvots un nevajadzīgs. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions.

 pats par sevi is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  negūtā peļņa is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal stemming from a full light verb construction (NV.LVC.full). NV describes the fact that a noun (N) is derived from a verb (V), whereas LVC.full refers to the full light verb construction which is the basis for this multiword expression. An English example is "decision maker", which stems from the LVC.full "(to) make (a) decision". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the deverbal noun does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Aizdomās turētā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival/adverbial modifier derived from a verbal idiom (AV.VID). Substituting individual lexemes by synonyms disrupts the idiomatic reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 because it is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 pēc tam is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Aizdomās turētā; 1,2|pēc tam; 15,16</think>Aizdomās turētā; 1,2|pēc tam; 15,16*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

 ātrās palīdzības is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1.

 pieņemt lēmumu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached.

It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Direktīvas 92/85 10.pants uzliek par pienākumu Dalībvalstīm nodrošināt grūtnieču atlaišanas aizliegumu. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  nodrošināt aizliegumu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: nodrošināt aizliegumu; 11,14</think>nodrošināt aizliegumu; 11,14*#*#*#*

If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Par pietiekami nopietnu ES tiesību pārkāpumu ir atzīta EKT judikatūras neņemšana vērā. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  neņemšana vērā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a NV.VID, i.e. a nominal phrase (N) that is derived from a verbal expression (V), where the verbal expression is a verbal idiom or VID. An example similar to the current one is the English NV.VID "a heart breaker", which derives from the VID "to break one's heart". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as it is lexically idiomatic: it takes on a meaning that is unique to this combination of words. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 spērusi soli is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Tikmēr uz ceļiem zaudēto dzīvību skaits divas reizes pieaudzis, salīdzinot aizvadīto janvāri ar pagājušā gada pirmo mēnesi. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  zaudēto dzīvību is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a NV.VID, i.e. a nominal phrase (N) that is derived from a verbal expression (V), where the verbal expression is a verbal idiom or VID. An example similar to the current one is the English NV.VID "a heart breaker", which derives from the VID "to break one's heart". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as it is lexically idiomatic: it takes on a meaning that is unique to this combination of words. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: zaudēto dzīvību; 4,5</think>zaudēto dzīvību; 4,5*#*#*#*

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  neskatoties uz is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 gadu no gada is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  no augšas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  nonācis redzeslokā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 saistībā ar is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: nonācis redzeslokā; 24,26|saistībā ar; 27,28</think>nonācis redzeslokā; 24,26|saistībā ar; 27,28*#*#*#*

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Nezin kāpēc olu ēst skaitījās nestilīgi – nedod dies’ ka kādu dalībnieku pieķertu to darot, izsmietu ne pa jokam! +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  nedod dies’ is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 ne pa jokam is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  saukt pie kriminālatbildības is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 saistībā ar is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 dots vērtējums is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ņemt vērā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  neliecies ne zinis is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: neliecies ne zinis; 6,9,10</think>neliecies ne zinis; 6,9,10*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1.

It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  gara gaismā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ceļā nestāties is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Gultā nedabūju is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Gultā nedabūju; 1,2</think>Gultā nedabūju; 1,2*#*#*#*

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  pārlaida acis is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: pārlaida acis; 2,3</think>pārlaida acis; 2,3*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  nelaidīs tautās is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  plikšķināja actiņas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Viena vienīga is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  uzsliet degunu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  noiets etaps is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: noiets etaps; 4,5</think>noiets etaps; 4,5*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”.

It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Viens no tiem — novērst valsts iedzīvotāju uzmanību no ekonomiskajām problēmām, aizbāzt muti tiem, kuri neapmierināti ar dzīvi, ar valsts vadītāju — politiķu nemākulību. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  aizbāzt muti is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: aizbāzt muti; 13,14</think>aizbāzt muti; 13,14*#*#*#*

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Viņš būtu ar mieru piedalīties ģimenes dzemdībās, bet mājdzemdības noraida. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:
1 Viņš
2 būtu
3 ar
4 mieru
5 piedalīties
6 ģimenes
7 dzemdībās
8 ,
9 bet
10 mājdzemdības

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  būtu ar mieru is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: būtu ar mieru; 2,3,4</think>būtu ar mieru; 2,3,4*#*#*#*

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Ņem vieglāk is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Ņem vieglāk; 1,3</think>Ņem vieglāk; 1,3*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  aizgājusi aizsaulē is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: aizgājusi aizsaulē; 10,11</think>aizgājusi aizsaulē; 10,11*#*#*#*

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  acīm redzams is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: acīm redzams; 3,4</think>acīm redzams; 3,4*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  nekrītiet izmisumā is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Filmēšanās seriālā un kāpšana uz Dailes teātra skatuves izrādē “Manu sievu sauc Moriss” nav vienīgais iemesls, kāpēc Egons ik nedēļu sēžas savā “Hondā” un mēro ceļu no Liepājas uz Rīgu. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  mēro ceļu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Visapkārt betona sienas, braucoši auto un ne miņas no viņa kaķu māmiņas tuvuma. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:
1 Visapkārt
2 betona
3 sienas
3.1(a contracted form consisting of the two following lemmas) ir

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ne miņas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: ne miņas; 8,9</think>ne miņas; 8,9*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  biezu ādu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: biezu ādu; 27,28</think>biezu ādu; 27,28*#*#*#*

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  dzima idejas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: dzima idejas; 6,8</think>dzima idejas; 6,8*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  turējušas pie vārda is a multiword expression.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  zviedru siena is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: zviedru siena; 26,27</think>zviedru siena; 26,27*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  iecērtot robu is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: iecērtot robu; 23,26</think>iecērtot robu; 23,26*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  mātes sabiedrības is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: mātes sabiedrības; 9,10</think>mātes sabiedrības; 9,10*#*#*#*

 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Treškārt, zāļu viltojumi. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:
