You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Na noite desta quarta (30), um policial foi morto a tiros em horário de folga, em Camboriú. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  a tiros is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 horário de folga is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: a tiros; 15,16|horário de folga; 18,19,20</think>a tiros; 15,16|horário de folga; 18,19,20*#*#*#*

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  a a medida que is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 foi tendo baixas is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: a a medida que; 3,4,5,6|foi tendo baixas; 11,12,13</think>a a medida que; 3,4,5,6|foi tendo baixas; 11,12,13*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 por questão de is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 para que is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  a o passo que is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 cerca de is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Ele já recebeu relatos de quem conseguiu trabalho acompanhando a conta. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  dá bônus is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: dá bônus; 18,19</think>dá bônus; 18,19*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  gabou se is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 se aplica is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  quarta-feira is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: O advogado chamou de ridícula essa manifestação do presidente do tribunal e disse que poderá exercer influência sobre os desembargadores. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  exercer influência is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  uma série de is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  torna se is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  se formaram is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  veio para cima is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently adpositional verb (IAV): a verb that forms a fixed unit with a specific adposition (similar to the English IAV “come across). The verb and adposition are fixed; substituting the preposition or verb with near‑synonyms disrupts the conventional reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 se desculpar is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: veio para cima; 2,3,4|se desculpar; 8,9</think>veio para cima; 2,3,4|se desculpar; 8,9*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 por o menos is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  contam com is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a fully non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.full. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas full refers to the fact that all parts of the given expression are non-compositional. This multiword expression is comparable to the English IVPC.full "to do in", where the meaning of the entire expression ("to kill") cannot be derived from either of its components. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as its meaning is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 se encerram is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: contam com; 8,9|se encerram; 14,15</think>contam com; 8,9|se encerram; 14,15*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  quarta-feira is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 de uma vez is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: É mais do que evidente que existe. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  meia-idade is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

 tenham razão is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  pedidos feitos is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: pedidos feitos; 3,4</think>pedidos feitos; 3,4*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Pediu demissão; 1,2</think>Pediu demissão; 1,2*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Pasta de dente não estraga e o preço sobe com o dólar. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ter robustez is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: ter robustez; 3,8</think>ter robustez; 3,8*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 servem alguma coisa is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Vale para a Colômbia, vale para o Brasil. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Além de não prestar socorro, ele aumentou a velocidade. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Além de is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  A gente is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  se apressou is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 quarta-feira is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  se encontra is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  fez viagens is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: fez viagens; 14,16</think>fez viagens; 14,16*#*#*#*

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  se torna is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: se torna; 19,20</think>se torna; 19,20*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'.

The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 tem conhecimento is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 a os poucos is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  dará se is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: dará se; 11,12</think>dará se; 11,12*#*#*#*

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  façam parecer is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 se esgotando is a multiword expression.

Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: em vez de; 8,9,10</think>em vez de; 8,9,10*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  próxima a is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  deu banho is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Com isso is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Com isso; 1,2</think>Com isso; 1,2*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Na delegacia, tudo foi desvendado e ela e Nilton foram detidos em flagrante. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  em flagrante is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  se apressar is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is a multi-verb construction, or MVC. MVCs are VMWEs composed by a sequence of two adjacent verbs (in a language-dependent order). These MVCs follow the following patterns: They usually have the same subject. They usually denote actions that are closely connected and may be seen as part of the same event. They function together as a single predicate. They are unaccompanied by any explicit coordination, subordination, or dependency marker. They only have a single tense, aspect and polarity value. They may be idiomatic or indicate successions of events. One of the verbs is semantically delexicalized and the other verb contains the core meaning of the whole. A similar MVC in English would be "(to) let go".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is semantically and syntactically idiomatic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  o que is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  quinta-feira is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  Estarão a a altura is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: Estarão a a altura; 1,2,3,4</think>Estarão a a altura; 1,2,3,4*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  quinta-feira is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
