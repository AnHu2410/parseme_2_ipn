You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: ,,Mijn basisniveau is flink omhoog gegaan.'' +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  omhoog gegaan is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  afgelopen is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival MWE (AV.IVPC.full) derived from a full verb–particle construction (IVPC.full). The construction is similar to that in the English AV.IVPC.full "run-down" (meaning "neglected"), which originates from the IVPC “to run down.” The construction consists of a fixed verb lexeme plus particle, which together undergo adjectivalization. The lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without altering acceptability or meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity and semantic shift. It also shows morphological/syntactic idiosyncrasy. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 meedoen is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semi-semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 meedoen aan is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently adpositional verb (IAV): a verb that forms a fixed unit with a specific adposition (similar to the English IAV “come across). The verb and adposition are fixed; substituting the preposition or verb with near‑synonyms disrupts the conventional reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is a fully non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.full. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas full refers to the fact that all parts of the given expression are non-compositional. This multiword expression is comparable to the English IVPC.full "to do in", where the meaning of the entire expression ("to kill") cannot be derived from either of its components. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as its meaning is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 zich concentreren is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Behalve Van Alebeek en haar ploeggenote Bertine Spijkerman was ook Saskia Kaagman uit de opleidingsploeg van Farm Frites meegesprongen. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  meegesprongen is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a fully non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.full. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas full refers to the fact that all parts of the given expression are non-compositional. This multiword expression is comparable to the English IVPC.full "to do in", where the meaning of the entire expression ("to kill") cannot be derived from either of its components. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as its meaning is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  ter voorbereiding op is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.

More precisely, it is an inherently adpositional verb (IAV): a verb that forms a fixed unit with a specific adposition (similar to the English IAV “come across). The verb and adposition are fixed; substituting the preposition or verb with near‑synonyms disrupts the conventional reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1.

More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 na denken is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semi-semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 na denken over is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently adpositional verb (IAV): a verb that forms a fixed unit with a specific adposition (similar to the English IAV “come across). The verb and adposition are fixed; substituting the preposition or verb with near‑synonyms disrupts the conventional reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1.

The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  te werk gaan is a multiword expression.

The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  voor het eerst is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 afgetroefd is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semi-semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: voor het eerst; 6,7,8|afgetroefd; 20</think>voor het eerst; 6,7,8|afgetroefd; 20*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'.

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: In de kwartfinale hadden de Egyptenaren echter redelijk overtuigend afgerekend met de Verenigde Staten (2 - 0). +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  afgerekend is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a fully non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.full. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas full refers to the fact that all parts of the given expression are non-compositional. This multiword expression is comparable to the English IVPC.full "to do in", where the meaning of the entire expression ("to kill") cannot be derived from either of its components. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as its meaning is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 afgerekend met is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently adpositional verb (IAV): a verb that forms a fixed unit with a specific adposition (similar to the English IAV “come across). The verb and adposition are fixed; substituting the preposition or verb with near‑synonyms disrupts the conventional reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Van der Vaart werd na een onbezonnen tackle met zijn tweede gele kaart bestraft. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  met bestraft is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently adpositional verb (IAV): a verb that forms a fixed unit with a specific adposition (similar to the English IAV “come across). The verb and adposition are fixed; substituting the preposition or verb with near‑synonyms disrupts the conventional reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 gele kaart is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

 invaller is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal derived from a full verb–particle construction (NV.IVPC.full). A similar construction in English is the noun "take-off", which originates from the VPC “to take off.” The nominalization preserves the fixed verb+particle combination and exhibits syntactic idiosyncrasy. The lexemes cannot be replaced by synonymous items without altering acceptability or meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the entire expression is not a sum of the meanings of its components. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 opgeroepen is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a fully non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.full.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: In de 68ste minuut namen de Egyptenaren een luid bejubelde en beslissende voorsprong. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  namen voorsprong is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: namen voorsprong; 5,13</think>namen voorsprong; 5,13*#*#*#*

More precisely, it is a fully non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.full. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas full refers to the fact that all parts of the given expression are non-compositional. This multiword expression is comparable to the English IVPC.full "to do in", where the meaning of the entire expression ("to kill") cannot be derived from either of its components. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as its meaning is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 een paar is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: Weer was een driesprong hem en zijn hengst Corland te machtig. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  te machtig is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: te machtig; 10,11</think>te machtig; 10,11*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms.

More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  alles gegeven is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: alles gegeven; 5,6</think>alles gegeven; 5,6*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'.

More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.

For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs.  afhaken is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal derived from a full verb–particle construction (NV.IVPC.full). A similar construction in English is the noun "take-off", which originates from the VPC “to take off.” The nominalization preserves the fixed verb+particle combination and exhibits syntactic idiosyncrasy. The lexemes cannot be replaced by synonymous items without altering acceptability or meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the entire expression is not a sum of the meanings of its components. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 behoefte had is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
 behoefte had aan is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently adpositional verb (IAV): a verb that forms a fixed unit with a specific adposition (similar to the English IAV “come across). The verb and adposition are fixed; substituting the preposition or verb with near‑synonyms disrupts the conventional reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 zich nestelde is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: afhaken; 7|behoefte had; 14,15|behoefte had aan; 14,15,16|zich nestelde; 26,34</think>afhaken; 7|behoefte had; 14,15|behoefte had aan; 14,15,16|zich nestelde; 26,34*#*#*#*

Now we apply the MWE criteria. The first condition is that the expression consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. The second condition is that it displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. The third condition is that it is not a multi-word named entity. Looking at the words, let's check for possible MWEs. After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: </think>*#*#*#*

You are a helpful system for identifying multiple-word expressions (MWEs). Identify all MWEs in the given sentence, and output their surface forms. Each sentence is a string of words delimited by'\n'. An MWE is defined as a sequence that satisfies the following three conditions. 1. It consists of multiple words that are always realized by the same lexemes. The individual lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without distorting the meaning of the expression as a whole or violating language conventions. 2. It displays semantic, lexical, or syntactic idiomaticity. Semantic idiomaticity occurs when the meaning of an expression cannot be explicitly derived from its components. Lexical idiomaticity occurs when one or more components of an expression are not used as stand-alone words in standard English. Syntactic idiomaticity occurs when the grammar of an expression cannot be derived directly from that of its components. For example, semantically idiomatic MWEs include 'break up', the lexically idiomatic include 'to and fro', and syntactically idiomatic MWEs include 'long time no see'. 3. It is not a multi-word named entity, i.e., a specific name of a person, facility, etc.
 Remember that you can identify congruent MWEs across different languages. For example, you can identify the Romanian MWE 'pur și simplu' because you know the English MWE 'pure and simple'. Similarly, the Portuguese MWE 'ter lugar' is easy to identify because of the English MWE 'take place'. And the French MWE 'feu de circulation' is easy to identify, because it is almost congruent to the English MWE 'traffic lights'. Respond by providing all tokens of the MWE, and their indices. If no MWE occurs, output 'None'. If there are multiple MWEs, separate them by |, for example 'to and fro; 7,8,9 | break up; 12, 13'. Sentence: De bezoekers die de ruiter wel naar de titel wilden toeklappen, beschaafd zoals het hoort bij paardensport. +++++++ <think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify all multiple-word expressions (MWEs) in the given sentence. The sentence is split into words by newlines, so first I need to parse each line as a token. Let me list them out with their indices to keep track. The words are:

More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
 afgereisd is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semi-semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
After considering all possibilities, my final answer is: waarvoor; 6|afgereisd; 13</think>waarvoor; 6|afgereisd; 13*#*#*#*
