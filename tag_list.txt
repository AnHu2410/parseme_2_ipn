LVC.full	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a full light verb construction (LVC.full) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb is semantically fully bleached. A similar bleaching occurs in the English MWE "(to) give (a) lecture". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the verb does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
NV.LVC.full	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal stemming from a full light verb construction (NV.LVC.full). NV describes the fact that a noun (N) is derived from a verb (V), whereas LVC.full refers to the full light verb construction which is the basis for this multiword expression. An English example is "decision maker", which stems from the LVC.full "(to) make (a) decision". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: the deverbal noun does not have its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is fully bleached. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
LVC.cause	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a causative light verb construction (LVC.cause) because it is formed by a verb and a noun, where the verb adds a causative meaning to the noun. It is similar to the following English LVC.cause: "(to) grant rights" or "to give a headache". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb displays semantic idiomaticity: it does not show its original meaning anymore, instead the meaning is reduced to a causative action. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
AV.IRV	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival or adverbial MWE (AV.IRV). AV means that it is an adjective or adverb that stems from a verb, whereas IRV refers to the inherently reflexive verb that the expression is based on. An IRV is a combination of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb does not exist, or it has a very different meaning when occurring without the clitic pronoun. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it conventionally has. The current expression is an adjectival/adverbial MWE that stems from such an IRV. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb is semantically idiomatic in that it takes on a meaning dissimilar from its original meaning. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
ConjID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a conjunction idiom or ConjID. It is comparable to the English ConjID "in that" in the following sentence: "she was fortunate in that she had friends to help her".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression displays syntactic idiomaticity. Also, the meaning of the expression is non-compositional. The expression is a conjunction and therefore does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
AdpID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adposition idiom or AdpID. It is comparable to the English AdpID "in front" in the following sentence: "in front of the station". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
AV.IVPC.semi	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival or adverbial MWE stemming from an IVPC.semi (AV.IVPC.semi). AV refers to the fact that this adjective or adverb (A) stems from a verbal expression (V), whereas IVPC-semi refers to the category of this verbal expression: an IVPC-semi is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle constructions. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
MVC	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a multi-verb construction, or MVC. MVCs are VMWEs composed by a sequence of two adjacent verbs (in a language-dependent order). These MVCs follow the following patterns: They usually have the same subject. They usually denote actions that are closely connected and may be seen as part of the same event. They function together as a single predicate. They are unaccompanied by any explicit coordination, subordination, or dependency marker. They only have a single tense, aspect and polarity value. They may be idiomatic or indicate successions of events. One of the verbs is semantically delexicalized and the other verb contains the core meaning of the whole. A similar MVC in English would be "(to) let go".  The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is semantically and syntactically idiomatic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
NV.MVC	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal stemming from an MVC, or NV.MVC. An MVC is a multi-verb construction. MVCs are VMWEs composed by a sequence of two adjacent verbs (in a language-dependent order). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is semantically and syntactically idiomatic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.  
AdjID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adjectival idiom (AdjID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It functions as an adjectival unit modifying a noun and exhibits fixed syntactic form (similar to the English AdjID "well-worn" in “a well-worn coat”, "up in arms" in “to be up in arms”, or "bottom-up" in “a bottom-up algorithm”). The words cannot be replaced by synonymous lexemes or freely inflected without altering the meaning or violating usage conventions, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity: the construction is semantically and syntactically irregular. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
AV.IVPC.full	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival MWE (AV.IVPC.full) derived from a full verb–particle construction (IVPC.full). The construction is similar to that in the English AV.IVPC.full "run-down" (meaning "neglected"), which originates from the IVPC “to run down.” The construction consists of a fixed verb lexeme plus particle, which together undergo adjectivalization. The lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without altering acceptability or meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through idiomaticity and semantic shift. It also shows morphological/syntactic idiosyncrasy. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
NID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a nominal idiom (NID), a universal MWE category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is a conventionalized noun phrase whose meaning is not fully compositional (as in similar English NIDs, such as “a big fish” meaning an important person or “hot dog” referring to a specific food item). The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, i.e. its non-compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
NV.IVPC.semi	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal derived from a verb–particle construction, which is semi-non-compositional (NV.IVPC.semi). The nominalization preserves the fixed verb+particle combination and exhibits syntactic idiosyncrasy. The lexemes cannot be replaced by synonymous items without altering acceptability or meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the entire expression is not a sum of the meanings of its components. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
NV.IRV	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal stemming from an IRV (NV.IRV). NV indicates that this nominal expression stems from a verbal expression, whereas IRV indicates that this verbal expression is an IRV. A verbal expression is an IRV if a verb does not exist, or it has a very different meaning without a clitic pronoun. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the expression is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
AV.IAV	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival or adverbial MWE derived from an inherently adpositional verb (AV.IAV). IAVs are verb–adposition units with a fixed preposition (e.g., “to come across,” “to rely on”); the derived forms preserve this fixed adposition and function as adjectival or adverbial modifiers. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes or with a different preposition without changing the meaning or violating usage, which satisfies condition 1. The expression fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the MWE is non-compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
AV.VID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival/adverbial modifier derived from a verbal idiom (AV.VID). Substituting individual lexemes by synonyms disrupts the idiomatic reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 because it is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
NV.VID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a NV.VID, i.e. a nominal phrase (N) that is derived from a verbal expression (V), where the verbal expression is a verbal idiom or VID. An example similar to the current one is the English NV.VID "a heart breaker", which derives from the VID "to break one's heart". The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as it is lexically idiomatic: it takes on a meaning that is unique to this combination of words. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
NV.IVPC.full	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal derived from a full verb–particle construction (NV.IVPC.full). A similar construction in English is the noun "take-off", which originates from the VPC “to take off.” The nominalization preserves the fixed verb+particle combination and exhibits syntactic idiosyncrasy. The lexemes cannot be replaced by synonymous items without altering acceptability or meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the entire expression is not a sum of the meanings of its components. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
NV.IAV	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal derived from an inherently adpositional verb (NV.IAV). IAVs are verb–adposition units with a fixed preposition; their nominalizations preserve that fixed adposition. The lexemes and the preposition are fixed: substituting synonyms or changing the preposition disrupts the construction or its meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as this NV.IAV shows non‑compositionality. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
IRV	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently reflexive verb (IRV) consisting of a verb and a clitic pronoun, where the verb **without the clitic** has a different meaning. For example, the English verb "to help" has a completely different meaning in "I helped myself to some cookies" than it has in "I helped him with his homework". The current expression is different from regular reflexive verbs such as "I washed myself", where the clitic pronoun does not change the meaning of the verb. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the construction as a whole, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb takes on a different meaning compared to its original meaning in combination with the clitic. The expression does not refer to a person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
IVPC.semi	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a semi non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.semi. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas semi refers to the fact that the particle adds a partly predictable but non-spatial meaning to the verb. One example for this MWE category is the English IVPC.semi "to eat up", where the meaning of the verb "eat" is conventional, but the particle "up" takes on a meaning that is not fully contained in its usual spatial sense, namely the meaning that the food should be eaten entirely. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semi-semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
IVPC.full	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a fully non-compositional idiomatic verb-particle construction, or IVPC.full. IVPC stands for idiomatic verb-particle constructions, whereas full refers to the fact that all parts of the given expression are non-compositional. This multiword expression is comparable to the English IVPC.full "to do in", where the meaning of the entire expression ("to kill") cannot be derived from either of its components. The individual words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without altering the meaning of the expression, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as its meaning is non‑compositional. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
NV.LVC.cause	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal nominal derived from a causative light-verb construction (NV.LVC.cause). The construction is similar to the construction “doubt-raiser” in English, which originates from the LVC.cause “to raise doubts”. In this construction, a verb combines with a noun and the verb contributes primarily causation rather than its full lexical meaning. The lexemes cannot be freely replaced by synonyms without altering the conventional meaning, which satisfies condition 1. The expression fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity: the verb’s meaning has a causative function. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
AV.LVC.cause	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival/adverbial modifier derived from a causative light‑verb construction (AV.LVC.cause). It originates from a light verb + noun pairing in which the verb's meaning takes on a causative function instead of its original meaning. The lexemes cannot be replaced by synonyms without altering the construction’s meaning, which satisfies condition 1. The expression fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity: the verb’s meaning has a causative function. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
IAV	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an inherently adpositional verb (IAV): a verb that forms a fixed unit with a specific adposition (similar to the English IAV “come across). The verb and adposition are fixed; substituting the preposition or verb with near‑synonyms disrupts the conventional reading or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
DetID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a determiner idiom (DetID): a fixed determiner-like sequence similar to the English DetID “every other day.” The lexemes are fixed; substituting synonyms alters the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as it is non-compositional. The expression does not refer to a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
PronID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a pronominal idiom (PronID), an MWE category comprising closed, conventionalized pronominal sequences (comparable to the English PronIDs “a few,” “no one,” “each other”). The lexemes and order are fixed and not freely replaceable by synonyms without altering meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 mainly through syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
VID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a verbal idiom (VID): a conventionalized verb phrase whose meaning is not compositional at all as in the English VIDs “go bananas” or “tumble dry”. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes without changing the idiomatic meaning or acceptability, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity, as the meaning of the words is non-compositional, and also syntactic idiomaticity. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
AdvID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an adverbial idiom (AdvID), a universal category characterized by lexical, morphological, or syntactic irregularity. It is comparable to English AdvIDs such as “on the whole” or “by and large.” The lexemes and order are fixed; substituting synonyms disrupts acceptability or the idiomatic meaning, which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2 through semantic idiomaticity (the expression is non-compositional). The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
AV.LVC.full	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is a deverbal adjectival/adverbial MWE derived from a full light‑verb construction (AV.LVC.full). Here, a light (i.e. semantically bleached) verb combines with a noun and yields modifier forms. The words cannot be realized by synonymous lexemes, which satisfies condition 1. The given expression fulfills condition 2, as the verb is semantically bleached in the source LVC. The expression does not refer to a specific person or place, so it also meets condition 3.
IntjID	is a multiword expression. More precisely, it is an interjection idiom (IntjID): a conventionalized exclamative unit used to express affect, as in the English IntjID “damn it!”. The lexemes are not replaceable by synonyms without altering acceptability or meaning (e.g., “condemn it!” does not convey the idiomatic force), which satisfies condition 1. It fulfills condition 2, because the meaning of the expression as a whole is not obvious from the meanings of the individual words. The expression does not denote a specific named entity, so it also meets condition 3.
